# Lab4-VanderlayIndustries
George is in a real pickle today, as he has filed for an unemployment extension, and claims to have been interviewed for as a latex salesman. we must do our part as Kramer royally screwed us when answering the phone. we must create a web-site that proves the legitimacy of Goerge's Claim.
 <hr><br>
In this lab, you must fill out the requirements for the website, as Jerry Seinfeld has given you the green light for your own personal design. You must make sure it is believable to an outsider that there are openings in the company. George has applied as a Latex salesperson, but it must seem to the unemployement office that there are many more roles that needs to be filled.
